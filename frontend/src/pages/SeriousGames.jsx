            <div className="text-block">
              <p>Serious games are more than just entertainment; they are a creative and powerful method to trigger people's intelligence and tap into their historical and recent knowledge of disaster events. Within our Living Labs, these games provide a dynamic platform for learning and strategy testing in a risk-free environment.</p>
              <p>They are designed to make complex concepts more understandable, promote critical thinking, and foster collaboration among diverse groupsâ€”from government officials to the public. By simulating extreme scenarios, we can co-create and test alternative disaster responses together.</p>
