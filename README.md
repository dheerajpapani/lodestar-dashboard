## **About The Project**

LODESTAR is a collaborative India-Netherlands research initiative designed to co-create a low-cost, multi-hazard early warning system (MH-EWS) for floods and droughts. This repository contains the source code for the project's primary user interface: a modern, responsive frontend dashboard.

The dashboard's core mission is to serve as a proof-of-concept for bridging the critical "know-do gap" in disaster management. It achieves this by presenting complex scientific data‚Äîsuch as real-time alerts, forecasts, and hydrological models‚Äîin a clear, accessible, and actionable format. It is designed to be a central hub for all project stakeholders, from citizens and community leaders to disaster management professionals and policy actors.

The entire application is built on the philosophy of co-creation, integrating advanced technology (AI/ML, remote sensing) with a bottom-up, community-focused approach through "Living Labs" and "Citizen Science".
